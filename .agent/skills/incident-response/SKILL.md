## Description

Diagnose production issues using logs, traces, and metrics.

## Instructions

- Check Vercel logs or Sentry for recent errors.

- Reproduce the issue in a local environment first.
- Communicate clearly with stakeholders during the "war room" phase.
- Write a post-mortem to prevent the issue from recurring.
