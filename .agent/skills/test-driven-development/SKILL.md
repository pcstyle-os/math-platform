# test-driven-development

## Description

Write tests before code. Guide the agent through TDD workflow.

## Instructions

1. **Red**: Write a failing test for the next small piece of functionality.
2. **Green**: Write the minimal amount of code to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while keeping the tests passing.

- Use mocks and stubs for external dependencies (API calls, database).
- Focus on behavior and edge cases, not just happy paths.
