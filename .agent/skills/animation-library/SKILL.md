## Description

Create smooth animations using Framer Motion or GSAP.

## Instructions

- **Framer Motion**: Use `initial`, `animate`, and `exit` for layout transitions and mounting animations.
- **GSAP**: Use for complex, timeline-based animations and high-performance scrolling effects.
- Prefer `layout` prop in Framer Motion for automatic layout animations.
- Keep animations subtle and intentional; avoid overwhelming the user.
- Ensure all animations can be disabled via `prefers-reduced-motion`.
