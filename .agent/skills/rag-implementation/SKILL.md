# rag-implementation

## Description

Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines (embeddings, vector DBs, search).

## Instructions

- **Chunking**: Split documents into manageable pieces with overlap.
- **Embeddings**: Use Gemini or OpenAI embedding models.
- **Vector Storage**: Integrate with Pinecone, Supabase Vector, or local HNSW libraries.
- **Retrieval**: Implement semantic search and hybrid search (keyword + semantic).
- **Generation**: Pass retrieved context to the LLM to generate grounded answers.
