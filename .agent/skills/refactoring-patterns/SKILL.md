# refactoring-patterns

## Description

Apply common refactoring patterns (Extract Method, Rename, Move, Inline).

## Instructions

- **Extract Method**: If a function is too long, move a logic block into a new function with a descriptive name.
- **Rename**: Use clear, intention-revealing names for variables and functions.
- **Move**: Shift classes or functions to more appropriate modules to improve cohesion.
- **Inline**: If a function/variable is simple and used only once, inline it to reduce complexity.
- Always run tests after each refactoring step.
