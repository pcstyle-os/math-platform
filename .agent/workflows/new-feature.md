description: Scaffold a new feature with branch and boilerplate.
---

1. Ask the user for the feature name (e.g., "auth-improvement") and a brief description.
2. Run `git checkout -b feat/<name>`.
3. Create necessary boilerplate files:
   - `components/<Name>.tsx`
   - `hooks/use<Name>.ts`
   - `app/<name>/page.tsx` (if needed)
4. Add a TODO item in `GEMINI.md` or a `TODO.md` file under a "Current Tasks" section.
5. Provide a summary of created files and the current branch.
