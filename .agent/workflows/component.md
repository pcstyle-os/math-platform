1. Ask for the component name (PascalCase).
2. Ask for the location (default: `components/`).
3. Ask if it needs local state (`useState`).
4. Generate the component file with:
   - Props interface.
   - JSDoc documentation.
   - Tailwind CSS for styling.
5. Generate a Vitest test file `components/<Name>.test.tsx`.
6. Inform the user when finished.
