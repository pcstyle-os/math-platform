# Conventional Commits

All commit messages generated by the agent must follow the Conventional Commits specification:

- `feat:` for new features.
- `fix:` for bug fixes.
- `docs:` for documentation changes.
- `style:` for formatting/UI changes that don't affect logic.
- `refactor:` for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
- `test:` for adding or correcting tests.
- `chore:` for updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.

Example: `feat: add math formula rendering to phase 1 theory`
